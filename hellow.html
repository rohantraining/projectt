                            <p>Back in 2013, I gave up my rented apartment and
                                sold most of my belongings. In the years since,
                                I’ve felt at home in many places around the
                                world but not put down roots anywhere.
                                Having no possessions and no commitment to a
                                single place felt liberating on many levels…
                                until I found myself in lockdown!
                                As luck would have it, an unexpected turn of
                                events made me abandon a multi-day trek from
                                tribal Chhattisgarh to Madhya Pradesh. I ended
                                up taking a flight to Dehradun to see my folks
                                for a few days, and figure out where I could
                                slow travel next to hide out the brewing
                                coronavirus fears.
                                In those few days, my universe, like that of
                                many others, overturned. WHO declared it a
                                pandemic, India went into a stringent lockdown,
                                state and international borders shut down
                                indefinitely. Suddenly, I had nowhere to go.
                                That few days visit turned into 3 months. And in
                                retrospect, I’m so glad I got to spend that
                                quality time with my folks – something I haven’t
                                done since I moved out for college at seventeen!
                                Unfortunately though, my partner was stranded in
                                a different part of the world during the
                                lockdown. Perhaps because the geographical
                                separation wasn’t out of choice this time, it
                                stung pretty bad.
                                When domestic movement gradually resumed, we
                                went through a ton of passes and paperwork,
                                Covid tests and institutional quarantine. And
                                took a leap of faith to move to a small Goan
                                village for the foreseeable future.
                                We now call an old trading shop turned studio
                                “home”, own a kayak and a small oven, and wake
                                up to hornbill and peacock cries!

                                and riding along steep mountain peaks has a lot
                                to offer apart from mesmerizing sights and
                                nature’s escapades.
                                The Great Wall of China offers plenty of
                                adventurous activities for adrenaline junkies
