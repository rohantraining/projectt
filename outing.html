                            <p>We arrived in Vancouver before 11:00, two flights in advance of the departure of the ship, 
                               as advised by the travel agent to avoid problems if WestJet cancelled or delayed our flight. 
                               No problems. The taxi took us through downtown Vancouver to Canada Place, which is where the 
                               cruise ships dock. (I asked about the new Central Library, and caught a glimpse of it. More anon.) 
                               The cruise ship passenger-processing area was a marvel of efficiency. A porter whisked away our heavy 
                               luggage with its special luggage tags. The taxi driver pointed out how to get back up to the street.
                               After a pause for reflection and to put our hand luggage in order, we walked a long hallway to the adjacent 
                               hotel and up onto the street. Setting off across a small plaza adorned with a spectacular planting of petunias, 
                               we spotted a pub. Hunger and our motto to drink a beer in every port drove us there, rather than in the 
                               direction of a food court. The temperature was just warm enough to let us sit outside at a sheltered table. 
                               Grey clouds and earlier rain were dissipating.
