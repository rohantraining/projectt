                    <p>Recently visited one of the famous rainforests in Canada. Canada's Great Bear Rainforest is the
                        largest intact temperate rainforest in the world—and one of the most magical, with elusive
                        species like sea wolves and Kermode bears roaming its 21 million acres. </p>
                    <p> Travel will take you on a nine-day excursion aboard a schooner, departing from British
                        Columbia's aboriginal First Nations community of Bella Bella and stopping for sea kayaking along
                        the way. While Canada is currently closed to U.S. travelers, you can always plan ahead for a
                        spring 2022 trip.
                        At the end of September Prince William and Kate visited the Great Bear Rainforest during their
                        royal tour of Canada. Unsurprisingly, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were suitably impressed.

                        The Great Bear Rainforest is one of the most pristine wilderness environments on Earth. In fact,
                        this tranquil and remote region is the world’s largest intact temperate rainforest. It stretches
                        some 250 miles along the central and north coast of British Columbia, reaching all the way
                        towards Alaska. Characterised by lush old growth forest, teeming wildlife and meandering fjords,
                        it is unique in the world.

                        Visitors heading to British Columbia on a Canadian holiday should certainly make the effort to
                        visit this vibrant and diverse ecosystem. We’ve got some really interesting facts and figures
                        about the rainforest to share with you. So find out what animals you could see and what you
                        should pack if you are heading to the region.
