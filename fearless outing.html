         <p> We arrived in Vancouver before 11:00, two flights in advance of the departure of the ship, as advised by the travel agent to avoid problems if WestJet cancelled or delayed our flight. No problems. The taxi took us through downtown Vancouver to Canada Place, which is where the cruise ships dock. (I asked about the new Central Library, and caught a glimpse of it. More anon.)
The cruise ship passenger-processing area was a marvel of efficiency. A porter whisked away our heavy luggage with its special luggage tags. 
The taxi driver pointed out how to get back up to the street. After a pause for reflection and to put our hand luggage in order, we walked a long hallway to the adjacent hotel and up onto the street. Setting off across a small plaza adorned with a spectacular planting of petunias, we spotted a pub. Hunger and our motto to drink a beer in every port drove us there, rather than in the direction of a food court. The temperature was just warm enough to let us sit outside at a sheltered table.
 Grey clouds and earlier rain were dissipating.</p>   </div>

        <p>Be prepared for three miles of relatively easy and scenic hiking.

If you love wildlife, you’ll likely agree that this is one of the best places to hike in the world.
Getting Here From NYC:
If you are planning on doing this hike from NYC, you’ll want to take a train from Penn Station to the last stop in Montauk. From the train station, it’s a 15-minute taxi/Uber to the trail.
Tour Option From NYC:
You can also book this private tour from NYC that includes visiting Montauk!.</p>
        <p>You can see them both from the beachfront and also from a nearby observation tower after you have completed the trail to Montauk Point.
The best time to visit is from the late fall to early spring, as this offers your best chances at seeing seals.</p>
