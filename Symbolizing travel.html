         <p>After almost a week of cruising through Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was new country time and we had decided to continue our road trip in Montenegro. It was cheaper to rent a different car in each country, so we dropped off our Bosnian car in Mostar and jumped on a bus to Herceg Novi, right across the border with Montenegro. I said cheaper, not quicker or less annoying.
Call it a lack of preparation but we hadn’t really understood that the bus didn’t go straight from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Montenegro. Hey, what’s the charm of a road trip if you have to plan everything ahead? Instead, it went from Bosnia into Croatia, back into Bosnia, back into Croatia and from there finally into Montenegro. Yes, that is a total of 4 border crossings and seeing Bosnia and Herzegovina isn’t part of the EU… yep, you get it…
Nine hours later (instead of the 4 that were announced) we finally got there. We jumped straight into our new car and were ready to hit the road again.

        <p>This time we have tried ourselves in Istup Canyoning. The route can take all day long, but it can be arranged for a shorter time. Adventure starts from Stolac and goes further to the old Ilirian settlement called Daorson (300 BC). After the visit of Daorson, the route goes to the village Berane. From Stolac to Berane you need about 1 hour drive with the bicycle.
After Berane goes the downhill part, into the Radimlja river canyon. With the bicycle you would need a maximum 30 minutes drive to the part where you continue by foot. 
The short fruit picking stop comes after you place the bicycle to safety and cool yourself in freshwater. Peaches are a perfect solution for body fluid recovery.
Fruits are the tasty announcement that the best part of the route is coming. Adventure throughout “Istup” is a lifetime experience.</p>
        <p>Stolac is a charming  old town between Trebinje and Mostar. From Dubrovnik to Stolac you would need about 1 hour and 40 minutes drive. If you are staying in Mostar, you can reach Stolac in approximately 40 minutes.
Stolac has a great history that dates from Ancient Greece, towards the Slavic times from the 7th century. Even though it has such an old history, most of the architecture dates from the Ottoman times (15th century).
Besides some mind intriguing history vicinity of Stolac is known for its amazing untouched nature which is perfect for canyoning, hiking, fishing, kayaking etc.
Funky Team has tried out the Istup Canyoning. Truly a once in a life time experience.
