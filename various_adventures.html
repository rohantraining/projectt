                            <p><b>Trekking</b>
                            <br></br>The diversity of treks through India include romps across wild meadows, 
                                cultural tours through anachronistic valleys, and demanding ascents of 
                                high altitude passes. Ladakh in the state of Jammu and Kashmir offers a 
                                wide variety of challenging trekking routes and is a destination rich in culture. 
                                The Sandakphu Phalut Trek in West Bengal offers grand vistas of the world’s four 
                                tallest mountains from rhododendron lined trails along the border of Nepal. 
                                The Valley of Flowers trek in Uttarakhand boasts a riot of exotic flora in its prime 
                                summer season. From here, one must venture onward to nearby Nanda Devi National Park,
                                 a UNESCO World Heritage Site, to gaze upon its namesake mountain, India’s second tallest 
                                 and arguably most beautiful peak. 
                                <br></br>
                                <b>Paragliding</b>
                                <br></br>With easy access and gorgeous rolling terrain, the entire state of Himachal Pradesh 
                                is an ethereal playground for paragliders. But if you had to choose just one place to start, 
                                the idyllic meadow launch point of Bir Billing above the village of Bir is perhaps the best.
                                Just beyond Manali, the Solang Valley with its steep terrain, thick pine forests, and surrounding 
                                snow capped peaks make it a crucible of adventure. However, it’s the stable, strong winds that 
                                make Solang an ideal paragliding destination for long flights most of the year.

                                <b>River Rafting</b>
                                <br></br>Rivers are held in high regard throughout India, especially among kayakers and rafters 
                                who hold a deep and profound reverence for the might and majesty of these Himalayan-fed rivers. 
                                From Gaumukh (“cow’s mouth”), the head of the sacred Ganges River, numerous rafting adventures 
                                of all grades abound as you head down its tributaries, including on the Bhagirathi, Alaknanda, and Mandakini.
                                The Zanskar River in Ladakh offers a class 4 rafting experience through a tight-walled canyon 
                                at over 4,000 meters elevation.

                                <b>Scuba Diving</b>
                                <br></br>When not snacking on fresh prawns, lobster, fish, and crabs flavored with spices 
                                using traditional Tandoori preparations, you can strap on your scuba gear and actually look 
                                at these abundant sea creatures living in a vibrant coral landscape surrounding the Andaman 
                                and Nicobar Islands. Check out the smoldering Barren Island, South Asia’s only active volcano, 
                                in the Andamans and explore turtles, manta rays, and a striking florescent coral cave at the 
                                Purple Haze dive site in some of the clearest water you’ve ever seen.
