                            <p>Hiking Is A Long, Vigorous Walk, Usually On Trails Or Footpaths In The Countryside. 
                              Hiking Involves A Long Energetic Walk In A Natural Environment On Hiking Trails Or Footpaths For A Day Or Overnight.
                              Hiking is the preferred term in Canada and the United States; the term "walking" is used in these regions for shorter, particularly urban walks. 
                              In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, the word "walking" describes all forms of walking, whether it is a walk in the park or backpacking in the Alps. The word hiking is also often used in the UK, along with rambling (a slightly old-fashioned term), hillwalking, and fell walking (a term mostly used for hillwalking in northern England). 
                              The term bushwalking is endemic to Australia, having been adopted by the Sydney Bush Walkers club in 1927.
                              In New Zealand a long, vigorous walk or hike is called tramping.
                              It is a popular activity with numerous hiking organizations worldwide, and studies suggest that all forms of walking have health benefits.
                              
                              
                              
                              The cost of hiking can range from as little as ten dollars to as much as a few thousand dollars depending on the type of hiking trtip you do. 
                              For local hikes, you can spend just ten dollars on some gas, water, and snacks. For entry-level gear, you can spend anywhere from $50 to $200.
